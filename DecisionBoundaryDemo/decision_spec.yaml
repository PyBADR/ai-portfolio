# HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP REQUIREMENTS
human_in_the_loop:
  mandatory: true
  
  requirements:
    - "Human must review all model suggestions"
    - "Human must provide independent judgment"
    - "Human must confirm final decision"
    - "Human must document rationale"
  
  enforcement:
    - "No decision finalized without human_confirms=True"
    - "Human must provide non-empty override_reason"
    - "System blocks autonomous operation"
    - "All confirmations logged in audit trail"

# AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE
audit:
  required: true
  
  logged_items:
    - "All inputs"
    - "All model outputs"
    - "Human decisions"
    - "Human rationale"
    - "Timestamps"
    - "Decision-maker identity"
  
  transparency:
    - "All decision logic is open source"
    - "Explanations provided for every decision"
    - "Governance constraints are explicit"
    - "Audit trail is complete and accessible"

# LIMITATIONS
limitations:
  - "Demonstration system only"
  - "Uses synthetic/generic data"
  - "Not for production use"
  - "No accuracy or performance claims"
  - "Simplified decision rules"
  - "No regulatory approval"
  - "No real-world validation"

# ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
ethics:
  transparency:
    - "No hidden logic or black box decisions"
    - "Uncertainty explicitly communicated"
    - "Human judgment preserved and required"
  
  accountability:
    - "Human decision-maker identified in audit trail"
    - "Rationale required and logged"
    - "Decision ownership is clear"
  
  safety:
    - "System cannot operate autonomously"
    - "Fail-safe defaults (reject on error)"
    - "Explicit capability constraints"
